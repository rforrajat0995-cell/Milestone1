# Only includes runtime dependencies needed for API functions

# Core RAG dependencies
google-generativeai>=0.3.0

# Consider alternatives if still exceeding 250MB limit
chromadb>=0.4.0

# Note: Removed heavy dependencies not needed at runtime:
# - pandas (not used in API functions)
# - beautifulsoup4, lxml (only needed for scraping, not API)
# - flask, flask-cors (not needed in serverless functions)
# - requests (not used in API functions)
#
