# Minimal requirements for Vercel serverless functions
# Using lightweight in-memory vector store instead of ChromaDB

# Core RAG dependencies
groq  # Groq LLM API (latest version)
python-dotenv
numpy
sentence-transformers  # For local embeddings (required with Groq)

# Streamlit (for Streamlit Cloud deployment)
streamlit>=1.28.0

# Note: ChromaDB removed - using SimpleVectorStore (numpy-based) instead
# This reduces size from ~250MB to ~50-100MB

# Note: Removed heavy dependencies not needed at runtime:
# - pandas (not used in API functions)
# - beautifulsoup4, lxml (only needed for scraping, not API)
# - flask, flask-cors (not needed in serverless functions)
# - requests (not used in API functions)
#
# For local development/scraping, install separately:
# pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml pandas flask flask-cors
